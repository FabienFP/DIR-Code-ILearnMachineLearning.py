# My Machine Learning
This repository is a collection of my works and projects related to Data Science and Machine Learning. In my scripts I use mainly Python and its dedicated librarys: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Sci-Kit Learn, Matplotlib, Basemap Plotly. I had also used some D3 for data visualizations. I also try to make custom implementations of algorithms known from Sci-Kit Learn library.

## Projects

* Regression
  * [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/SkalskiP/My_Machine_Learning/tree/master/01_Regression/01_Simple_Linear_Regression)
  * [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/SkalskiP/My_Machine_Learning/tree/master/01_Regression/02_Polynomial_Regression)

* Clustering
  * [K-Means](https://github.com/SkalskiP/My_Machine_Learning/tree/master/02_Custering/02_K-Means)

* Classification
  * [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/SkalskiP/My_Machine_Learning/tree/master/03_Classification/01_K_Nearest_Neighbor)
  * [Decision Trees](https://github.com/SkalskiP/My_Machine_Learning/tree/master/03_Classification/02_Decision_Trees)

## Keggle
For some time, I am also quite active on Kaggle:

* [GPUs Dataset Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/skalskip/using-regression-to-predict-gpus-of-the-future) - using several kinds of regression to predict technical parameters of GPUs in future.
* [FIFA 18 Data Exploration and Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/skalskip/fifa-18-data-exploration-and-d3-js-visualization) - using D3, plotly and seaborn for data visualization.
* [How big is French Industry?](https://www.kaggle.com/skalskip/how-big-is-french-industry-data-visualization) - deep dive into Kaggle dataset containing information about French industry. The use of libraries such as Plotly and Basemap has allowed me to create truly beautiful visuals.
